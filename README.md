TBMoST is highly modular, computationally efficient, 
and has an intuitive and easy-to-use API, 
making it suitable for theoretical studies to numerical simulations, 
helping researchers to deeply explore Moiré physics 
and the properties of novel 2D material electronic systems.

In addition, TBMoST can generate band structure, 
Fermi surface, density of state diagrams and 
other material physics images, allowing users to understand the calculation results more intuitively.

Whether it is studying novel quantum phenomena in Moiré superlattices 
or developing and regulating the electronic properties of two-dimensional materials, 
TBMoST can provide strong support to make research more efficient and precise! 🚀
