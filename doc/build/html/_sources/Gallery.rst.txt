Corrugation effect and band structure
---------------------------------------

The black solid lines in both images represent the results considering lattice relaxation, 
while the red dashed lines correspond to the band structure of rigid TBG. 
The left panel shows the results calculated using TBMoST, 
which only account for the corrugation correction. 
The right panel presents results from the reference `Phys. Rev. B 96, 075311 <https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.96.075311>`_,
where both out-of-plane and in-plane deformation corrections are considered.


Twisted double bilayer graphene

The left figure is the band structure calculated using TBMoST, 
and the right figure is the result from `Nano letters 20.4 (2020): 2410-2415 <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b05117>`_. 
The polarization between layers is considered in the calculation, so a tiny bandgap appears.
