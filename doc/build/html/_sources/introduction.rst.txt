This package is specially designed for processing **twisted-layer materials**, 
and can efficiently calculate and analyze a variety of physical properties, including:

- **Band Structure**
- **Density of States (DOS)**
- **Spectral Function**
- **Fermi Surface**
- **Dynamical Conductivity**
- **Berry Curvature**, etc.

TBMoST is **highly modular**, **computationally efficient**, 
and has an **intuitive and easy-to-use API**, 
making it suitable for **theoretical studies** to **numerical simulations**, 
helping researchers to deeply explore **Moiré physics** 
and **the properties of novel 2D material electronic systems**.

In addition, TBMoST can generate **band structure**, 
**Fermi surface**, **density of state diagrams** and 
**other material physics images**, allowing users to understand the calculation results more intuitively.

Whether it is **studying novel quantum phenomena in Moiré superlattices** 
or **developing and regulating the electronic properties of two-dimensional materials**, 
TBMoST can provide strong support to make research more efficient and precise! 🚀
